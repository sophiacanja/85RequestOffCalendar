# 85c Bakery Request-Off Calendar 

This full-stack web application manages the days-off requested by employees for vacation.

## Description

Sophia Canja was the Cake Department Lead of her local 85c Bakery. Their department did not have an effective way for employees to request-off for vacation days. Originally, employees would text Sophia at the beginning of every month for the days they wanted off, however, this method resulted in multiple schedule conflicts and issues. 

This full-stack web application manages the days-off requested by employees for vacation. Employees are given an account where they can request the days they want off using a calendar that marks and highlights the dates. Employee accounts are able to select multiple dates, and submit or delete their requests. Administrator accounts will have the option to view a list of employees who requested off on specific days, as well as add or delete employees from the database. All accounts can update their personal information and can also create a new password using a unique link that is emailed to the user. Overall, this web application is a user friendly, simple interface that effectively manages requested days-off. 

The use of this application resulted in better communication between the manager and employees. Schedule conflicts were avoided, and schedule making became easier due to being able to see which employees could not work on specific days. These issues were prevalent and frequent, before the creation of this application. An anonymous survey amongst the staff displayed a 30% reduction in employee scheduling conflicts and received a 4.5/5 rating.
